Adding new map:
----------------------
Place the PNG into Assets folder and set the asset's fields:
	- Read/Write Enabled: true
	- Filter Mode: Point (no filter)
	- Format: RGBA 32 bit

Then slide the asset into the "Input" field on the Pathfinder's game object.

Colors:
--------
Use the color sliders in the Pathfinder's inspector to set the meaning of the colors on the input image (ex: 0,0,0,1 is empty tile, 1,0,0,1 is target tile, etc.)
If an unexpected color is read from the image, an error will be displayed.

Parameters:
-----------
	- Draw Open Set / Closed Set / Path / Parents: whether or not to overlay colored tiles corresponding to those elements.
	- Tile Size: if you need to adjust the gizmo's cube tile size.
	- Ignore diagonal cost increase: A* only. Whether or not to take into account that moving diagonally is harder than cardinally.
	- Disable Step by Step: calculate whole path in one go.
	- Wall Cost: A* only. Increase the value to prevent the algorithm from going full Kool Aid Man on you.
	- Slow Down Cost: A* only. Defines cost of traversal of slow down tiles.
	- Allow Diagonal Movement: Whether or not the algorithm should be allowed to move diagonally.
	- Heuristic Multiplier: use to increase / decrease weight of the heuristic's cost. Creates sub optimal paths though.

Note on drawString() method:
----------------------------
This method can be used to draw text on the viewport (like g and h costs). It gets laggy with large maps though.
